> Sometimes people do want to emphasize that they are doing less pre-processing or post-processing than others, and then they might invoke a term such as “end-to-end” meaning that they removed some extra processing step that was at common at some point. But it’s never total. There’s always some sort of unpacking and repacking on either end of a real-world system.
